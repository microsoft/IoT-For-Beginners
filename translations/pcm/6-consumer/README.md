For di beginning, dem start with hour glass - your food go don cook when all di sand don waka go di bottom bulb. Later, dem change am to clockwork, then electric.

> 💁 Dis lessons go use some cloud resources. If you no finish all di lessons for dis project, make sure say you [clean up your project](../clean-up.md).
