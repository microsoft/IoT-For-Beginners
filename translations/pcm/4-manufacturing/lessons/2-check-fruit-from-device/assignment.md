# Respond to classification results

## Instructions

Your device don classify images, and e get di values for di predictions. Your device fit use dis information do somtin - e fit send am go IoT Hub make other systems process am, or e fit control actuator like LED wey go light up wen di fruit no ripe.

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Respond to predictions | E fit implement response to predictions wey dey work well well wit predictions wey get di same value. | E fit implement response wey no depend on di predictions, like just dey send raw data go IoT Hub | E no fit program di device make e respond to di predictions |
