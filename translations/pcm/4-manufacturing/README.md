# Manufacturing and processing - how IoT fit help make food processing beta

Wen food don reach central hub or processing plant, e no dey always just waka go supermarket. Many times, dem dey process di food first, like to sort am by quality. Before-before, na manual work dem dey do - e go start for farm wen di pickers go dey pick only ripe fruit, den for factory di fruit go dey move for conveyer belt and workers go dey use hand remove any fruit wey don spoil or get bruise. I don pick and sort strawberry before as summer job wen I dey school, so I fit talk say dis work no sweet at all.

Di modern way now na to use IoT for sorting. Some of di first devices like di sorters wey [Weco](https://wecotek.com) get dey use optical sensors to check di quality of di produce, like to reject green tomatoes. Dis kind machine fit dey inside harvesters for farm or for processing plants.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) dey improve, di machines dey get more sense. Dem fit use ML models wey dem don train to sabi di difference between fruit and foreign objects like stone, sand or insect. Di models fit also sabi check di quality of di fruit, no be only bruised fruit but even early signs of disease or other crop wahala.

> 🎓 Di word *ML model* mean di result wey you go get after you don train machine learning software with data. For example, you fit train ML model to sabi di difference between ripe and unripe tomatoes, den use di model check new images to know if di tomatoes don ripe or never ripe.

For dis 4 lessons, you go learn how to train AI models wey dey use image to check fruit quality, how to use dem with IoT device, and how to run dem for di edge - dat one mean to run am for IoT device instead of di cloud.

> 💁 Dis lessons go use some cloud resources. If you no finish all di lessons for dis project, make sure say you [clean up your project](../clean-up.md).
