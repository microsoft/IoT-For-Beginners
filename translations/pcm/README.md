# IoT for Beginners - A Curriculum

Azure Cloud Advocates for Microsoft don prepare 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum wey dey teach di basics of IoT. Each lesson get quiz before and after di lesson, written instructions, solution, assignment and more. Di project-based style go help you learn well as you dey build, wey be one sure way to make new skills stick.

Di projects dey show how food dey move from farm go table. E include farming, logistics, manufacturing, retail and consumer - all na popular industry areas for IoT devices.

![A road map for di course wey show 24 lessons wey cover intro, farming, transport, processing, retail and cooking](../../translated_images/Roadmap.bb1dec285dda0eda691788b95ddfc96d31d76bb7649e3f04a135e4ad395f323e.pcm.jpg)

**Big thanks to our authors [Jen Fox](https://github.com/jenfoxbot), [Jen Looper](https://github.com/jlooper), [Jim Bennett](https://github.com/jimbobbennett), and our sketchnote artist [Nitya Narasimhan](https://github.com/nitya).**

**Thanks too to our team of [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com?WT.mc_id=academic-17441-jabenn) wey don dey review and translate dis curriculum - [Aditya Garg](https://github.com/AdityaGarg00), [Anurag Sharma](https://github.com/Anurag-0-1-A), [Arpita Das](https://github.com/Arpiiitaaa), [Aryan Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryan-jain-47a4a1145/), [Bhavesh Suneja](https://github.com/EliteWarrior315), [Faith Hunja](https://faithhunja.github.io/), [Lateefah Bello](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lateefah-bello/), [Manvi Jha](https://github.com/Severus-Matthew), [Mireille Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mireille-tan-a4834819a/), [Mohammad Iftekher (Iftu) Ebne Jalal](https://github.com/Iftu119), [Mohammad Zulfikar](https://github.com/mohzulfikar), [Priyanshu Srivastav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyanshu-srivastav-b067241ba), [Thanmai Gowducheruvu](https://github.com/innovation-platform), and [Zina Kamel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zina-kamel/).**

> **Teachers**, we don [add some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how una fit use dis curriculum. If you wan create your own lessons, we don also add [lesson template](lesson-template/README.md).

> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**, if you wan use dis curriculum by yourself, fork di whole repo and do di exercises by yourself. Start with di pre-lecture quiz, read di lecture and finish di activities. Try build di projects by understanding di lessons instead of copying di solution code; but di code dey available for di /solutions folders for each project-oriented lesson. Another idea na to form study group with your friends and go through di content together. For more study, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/users/jimbobbennett/collections/ke2ehd351jopwr?WT.mc_id=academic-17441-jabenn).

## Pedagogy

We choose two teaching styles wen we dey build dis curriculum: make e dey project-based and make e get plenty quizzes. By di end of dis series, students go don build plant monitoring and watering system, vehicle tracker, smart factory setup to track and check food, and voice-controlled cooking timer. Dem go don learn di basics of Internet of Things like how to write device code, connect to di cloud, analyze telemetry and run AI for di edge.

As we make di content align with projects, e go make am more interesting for students and e go help dem remember di concepts well.

Plus, quiz wey no dey too hard before class go help di student focus on di topic wey dem wan learn, while di second quiz after class go help dem remember am well. Dis curriculum dey flexible and fun, and you fit take am complete or small small. Di projects dey start small and e dey grow complex by di end of di 12-week cycle.

Each project dey use real-world hardware wey students and hobbyists fit get. Each project dey look into di specific project domain, dey give background knowledge wey dey relevant. To be beta developer, e good make you understand di domain wey you dey solve problem for. Dis background knowledge go help students think about their IoT solutions and learnings for di context of di kind real-world problem wey dem fit solve as IoT developer. Students go learn di 'why' of di solutions wey dem dey build, and dem go appreciate di end user.

## Hardware

We get two options of IoT hardware wey you fit use for di projects based on wetin you like, di programming language wey you sabi, your learning goals and wetin dey available. We don also provide 'virtual hardware' version for people wey no get access to hardware or wan learn more before dem buy. You fit read more and find 'shopping list' for di [hardware page](./hardware.md), including links to buy complete kits from our friends for Seeed Studio.

> 💁 Check our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We dey welcome your constructive feedback!

## Each lesson get:

- sketchnote
- optional video wey dey add more info
- pre-lesson warmup quiz
- written lesson
- for project-based lessons, step-by-step guide on how to build di project
- knowledge checks
- challenge
- extra reading
- assignment
- [post-lesson quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/)
> **Small info about quizzes**: All di quizzes dey inside di quiz-app folder, e get 48 quizzes wey each one get three questions. Dem link am from di lessons, but di quiz app fit run for your computer or you fit put am for Azure; follow di instruction wey dey inside di `quiz-app` folder. Dem dey localize am small small.
