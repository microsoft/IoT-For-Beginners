# Transport from farm go factory - how IoT fit track food wey dem dey deliver

Plenty farmers dey grow food to sell - e fit be say dem be commercial farmers wey dey sell all di food wey dem grow, or dem be subsistence farmers wey dey sell di extra food wey dem get to take buy wetin dem need. Somehow, di food gatz move from di farm go meet di people wey go chop am, and dis one dey usually depend on bulk transport from di farms, go hubs or processing plants, then go stores. For example, tomato farmer go harvest di tomatoes, pack dem inside boxes, load di boxes for truck, then deliver am go processing plant. Di tomatoes go then dey sorted, and from there dem go deliver am to di people wey go chop am as processed food, retail sales, or for restaurants.

IoT fit help for dis supply chain by tracking di food wey dey transit - e go make sure say di drivers dey go where dem suppose go, e go dey monitor di location of di vehicles, and e go dey give alerts when di vehicles don reach so dat dem fit offload di food, and make am ready for processing quick quick.

> 🎓 *Supply chain* na di steps wey dem dey follow to make and deliver something. For example, for tomato farming, e go cover seed, soil, fertilizer and water supply, growing di tomatoes, delivering di tomatoes go central hub, transporting dem go supermarket local hub, transporting dem go di individual supermarket, arranging dem for display, then selling am to di consumer wey go carry am go house to chop. Each step be like di links for chain.

> 🎓 Di transportation part of di supply chain na wetin dem dey call *logistics*.

For dis 4 lessons, you go learn how Internet of Things fit help improve di supply chain by monitoring di food as dem dey load am for (virtual) truck, wey dem go track as e dey move go di destination. You go learn about GPS tracking, how to store and visualize GPS data, and how to get alert when di truck don reach di destination.
