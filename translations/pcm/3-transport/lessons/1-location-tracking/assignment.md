# Check other GPS data

## Wetin you go do

Di NMEA sentences wey dey come from your GPS sensor get other tori apart from location. Check di extra tori wey dey, and use am for your IoT device.

Example - you fit collect di current date and time? If you dey use microcontroller, you fit set di clock using GPS data di same way wey you take set am using NTP signals for di last project? You fit collect elevation (how high you dey above sea level), or di speed wey you dey waka?

If you dey use virtual IoT device, you fit collect some of dis tori by sending NMEA sentences wey tools like [nmeagen.org](https://www.nmeagen.org) generate.

## Marking Guide

| Criteria | Beta | Okay | E no good |
| -------- | ----- | ----- | --------- |
| Collect more GPS tori | Fit collect and use more GPS tori, either as telemetry or to set up di IoT device | Fit collect more GPS tori, but e no fit use am | E no fit collect more GPS tori |
