# Build new IoT device

## Instructions

For di last 6 lessons, you don learn about digital agriculture and how to use IoT devices to gather data wey go help predict how plant go grow, and how to automate watering based on soil moisture readings.

Use wetin you don learn to build new IoT device wey go use sensor and actuator of your choice. Send telemetry go IoT Hub, and use am to control actuator through serverless code. You fit use sensor and actuator wey you don already use for dis or di previous project, or if you get other hardware, try something new.

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Code IoT device to use sensor and actuator | Code IoT device wey dey work with sensor and actuator | Code IoT device wey dey work with sensor or actuator | No fit code IoT device to use sensor or actuator |
| Connect IoT device to IoT Hub | Fit deploy IoT Hub, send telemetry go am, and receive commands from am | Fit deploy IoT Hub and either send telemetry or receive commands | No fit deploy IoT Hub or communicate with am from IoT device |
| Control actuator using serverless code | Fit deploy Azure Function to control di device wey telemetry events trigger | Fit deploy Azure Function wey telemetry events trigger but no fit control di actuator | No fit deploy Azure Function |
