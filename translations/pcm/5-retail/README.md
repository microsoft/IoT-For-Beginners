# Retail - how IoT fit help manage stock levels

Di last stage wey feed dey pass before e reach di people wey go chop am na retail - di markets, greengrocers, supermarkets and stores wey dey sell food give people. Dis stores wan make sure say dem get food for shelves wey people fit see and buy.

One of di work wey dey take plenty time for food stores, especially for big supermarkets, na to make sure say shelves dey full. To dey check each shelf one by one to make sure say any space wey dey empty dey fill up with food wey dey store room.

IoT fit help for dis one, e go use AI models wey dey run for IoT devices to count stock, e go use machine learning models wey no just dey classify images, but fit detect each object and count dem.

For dis 2 lessons, you go learn how to train image-based AI models to count stock, and how to run dis models for IoT devices.

> 💁 Dis lessons go use some cloud resources. If you no finish all di lessons for dis project, make sure say you [clean up your project](../clean-up.md).
