# Recommended learning model

To get beta result for learning, **we dey recommend “Flipped Model" approach** like science lab: students go dey work on projects for class time, with chance to discuss, ask questions, and get help for their project, and dem go do the lecture part as pre-reads for dia own time.

## Why Flipped Learning?

1. Dis kind teaching dey use different learning methods – visual, listening, hands-on, problem solving, etc.[[1]](../..)
2. Flipped classrooms don show say e dey increase focus, engagement, motivation, self-confidence, knowledge retention, and communication (both teacher-to-student and student-to-student).[[2,3]](../..)
3. As teacher, you fit spend more time with students wey dey struggle while you go allow students wey don sabi well well to move ahead.[[4]](../..)

We dey also recommend say teachers go take the role of **“Co-Facilitator"** wey go dey learn with students and dey support dem as dem dey work through questions and explore things wey dem dey curious about.

No be say one way dey correct pass for dis kind thing. Sometimes, you no go get all the answers. Some students fit no finish all the projects. Your work na to help your students find ways to solve problems wey fit dey more playful, collaborative, or self-directed pass wetin dem first think.

## Helpful Facilitation Tips:

* Think about wetin you notice, ask questions, and talk about wetin you observe.
* Use words like “I notice…" and “I wonder…"
* Link students wey dey struggle with students wey don already find solution.
* Point to parts or suggest different things wey dem fit try if student dey stuck. Tell the student make dem change one thing at a time and see wetin go happen.
* Show say you understand frustration and appreciate effort.
* No dey build or code for the students, unless dem need physical help.

## Sample Facilitation Language:

* “Ask two other people before you ask me."
* “Try for another two minutes…"
* “Make we take break from dis one. Maybe you fit help other students with their electrical connections since you don already figure am out?"
* “I dey wonder if another student don get dis same problem. Make we check!"
* "You really put effort for dis and you figure am out! I fit send other students to you make you help dem with dis?"
* “E dey strange, e no make sense to me too. Maybe we fit ask another student, or if you figure am out you fit share with the class?"
