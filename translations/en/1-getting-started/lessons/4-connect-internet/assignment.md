# Compare and contrast MQTT with other communication protocols

## Instructions

This lesson covered MQTT as a communication protocol. There are others, including AMQP and HTTP/HTTPS.

Research both of these and compare/contrast them with MQTT. Consider aspects such as power consumption, security, and message persistence in case of connection loss.

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Compare AMQP to MQTT | Successfully compares and contrasts AMQP to MQTT, addressing power consumption, security, and message persistence. | Partially compares and contrasts AMQP to MQTT, addressing two of the following: power consumption, security, or message persistence. | Partially compares and contrasts AMQP to MQTT, addressing only one of the following: power consumption, security, or message persistence. |
| Compare HTTP/HTTPS to MQTT | Successfully compares and contrasts HTTP/HTTPS to MQTT, addressing power consumption, security, and message persistence. | Partially compares and contrasts HTTP/HTTPS to MQTT, addressing two of the following: power consumption, security, or message persistence. | Partially compares and contrasts HTTP/HTTPS to MQTT, addressing only one of the following: power consumption, security, or message persistence. |
