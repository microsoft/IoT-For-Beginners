# Control your nightlight over the Internet - Wio Terminal

The IoT device needs to be programmed to communicate with *test.mosquitto.org* using MQTT to send telemetry data based on the light sensor readings and receive commands to control the LED.

In this part of the lesson, you will connect your Wio Terminal to an MQTT broker.

## Install the WiFi and MQTT Arduino libraries

To communicate with the MQTT broker, you need to install some Arduino libraries to use the WiFi chip in the Wio Terminal and interact with MQTT. When developing for Arduino devices, you can leverage a wide range of libraries containing open-source code that implement various functionalities. Seeed provides libraries for the Wio Terminal that enable WiFi communication. Other developers have created libraries for interacting with MQTT brokers, which you will use with your device.

These libraries are available as source code that can be automatically imported into PlatformIO and compiled for your device. This ensures Arduino libraries work on any device supporting the Arduino framework, provided the device has the necessary hardware for the library. Some libraries, like the Seeed WiFi libraries, are specific to certain hardware.

Libraries can be installed globally for reuse or directly into a specific project. For this assignment, the libraries will be installed into the project.

‚úÖ You can learn more about library management and how to find and install libraries in the [PlatformIO library documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/librarymanager/index.html).

### Task - install the WiFi and MQTT Arduino libraries

Install the Arduino libraries.

1. Open the nightlight project in VS Code.

1. Add the following to the end of the `platformio.ini` file:

    ```ini
    lib_deps =
        seeed-studio/Seeed Arduino rpcWiFi @ 1.0.5
        seeed-studio/Seeed Arduino FS @ 2.1.1
        seeed-studio/Seeed Arduino SFUD @ 2.0.2
        seeed-studio/Seeed Arduino rpcUnified @ 2.1.3
        seeed-studio/Seeed_Arduino_mbedtls @ 3.0.1
    ```

    This imports the Seeed WiFi libraries. The `@ <number>` syntax specifies a particular version of the library.

    > üíÅ You can remove the `@ <number>` to always use the latest version of the libraries, but there‚Äôs no guarantee that newer versions will work with the code below. The code provided here has been tested with this specific version of the libraries.

    This is all you need to do to add the libraries. The next time PlatformIO builds the project, it will download the source code for these libraries and compile them into your project.

1. Add the following to the `lib_deps`:

    ```ini
    knolleary/PubSubClient @ 2.8
    ```

    This imports [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient), an Arduino MQTT client.

## Connect to WiFi

The Wio Terminal can now be connected to WiFi.

### Task - connect to WiFi

Connect the Wio Terminal to WiFi.

1. Create a new file in the `src` folder called `config.h`. You can do this by selecting the `src` folder or the `main.cpp` file inside it, and clicking the **New file** button in the explorer. This button appears when your cursor hovers over the explorer.

    ![The new file button](../../../../../translated_images/vscode-new-file-button.182702340fe6723c8cbb4cfa1a9a9fb0d0a5227643b4e46b91ff67b07a39a92f.en.png)

1. Add the following code to this file to define constants for your WiFi credentials:

    ```cpp
    #pragma once

    #include <string>
    
    using namespace std;
    
    // WiFi credentials
    const char *SSID = "<SSID>";
    const char *PASSWORD = "<PASSWORD>";
    ```

    Replace `<SSID>` with your WiFi network name. Replace `<PASSWORD>` with your WiFi password.

1. Open the `main.cpp` file.

1. Add the following `#include` directives to the top of the file:

    ```cpp
    #include <PubSubClient.h>
    #include <rpcWiFi.h>
    #include <SPI.h>
    
    #include "config.h"
    ```

    This includes header files for the libraries you added earlier, as well as the config header file. These header files are necessary to instruct PlatformIO to include the code from the libraries. Without explicitly including these header files, some code won‚Äôt be compiled, resulting in compiler errors.

1. Add the following code above the `setup` function:

    ```cpp
    void connectWiFi()
    {
        while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED)
        {
            Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi..");
            WiFi.begin(SSID, PASSWORD);
            delay(500);
        }
    
        Serial.println("Connected!");
    }
    ```

    This code loops while the device is not connected to WiFi and attempts to connect using the SSID and password from the config header file.

1. Add a call to this function at the bottom of the `setup` function, after the pins have been configured.

    ```cpp
    connectWiFi();
    ```

1. Upload this code to your device to verify the WiFi connection. You should see the output in the serial monitor.

    ```output
    > Executing task: platformio device monitor <
    
    --- Available filters and text transformations: colorize, debug, default, direct, hexlify, log2file, nocontrol, printable, send_on_enter, time

    --- Quit: Ctrl+C | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---
    Connecting to WiFi..
    Connected!
    ```

## Connect to MQTT

Once the Wio Terminal is connected to WiFi, it can connect to the MQTT broker.

### Task - connect to MQTT

Connect to the MQTT broker.

1. Add the following code to the bottom of the `config.h` file to define the connection details for the MQTT broker:

    ```cpp
    // MQTT settings
    const string ID = "<ID>";
    
    const string BROKER = "test.mosquitto.org";
    const string CLIENT_NAME = ID + "nightlight_client";
    ```

    Replace `<ID>` with a unique ID that will serve as the name of this device client and later for the topics this device publishes and subscribes to. The *test.mosquitto.org* broker is public and used by many people, including other students working on this assignment. Using a unique MQTT client name and topic names ensures your code won‚Äôt interfere with others. You will also need this ID when creating the server code later in this assignment.

    > üíÅ You can use a website like [GUIDGen](https://www.guidgen.com) to generate a unique ID.

    The `BROKER` is the URL of the MQTT broker.

    The `CLIENT_NAME` is a unique name for this MQTT client on the broker.

1. Open the `main.cpp` file, and add the following code below the `connectWiFi` function and above the `setup` function:

    ```cpp
    WiFiClient wioClient;
    PubSubClient client(wioClient);
    ```

    This code creates a WiFi client using the Wio Terminal WiFi libraries and uses it to create an MQTT client.

1. Below this code, add the following:

    ```cpp
    void reconnectMQTTClient()
    {
        while (!client.connected())
        {
            Serial.print("Attempting MQTT connection...");
    
            if (client.connect(CLIENT_NAME.c_str()))
            {
                Serial.println("connected");
            }
            else
            {
                Serial.print("Retying in 5 seconds - failed, rc=");
                Serial.println(client.state());
                
                delay(5000);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    This function tests the connection to the MQTT broker and reconnects if it is not connected. It loops continuously while disconnected and attempts to connect using the unique client name defined in the config header file.

    If the connection fails, it retries after 5 seconds.

1. Add the following code below the `reconnectMQTTClient` function:

    ```cpp
    void createMQTTClient()
    {
        client.setServer(BROKER.c_str(), 1883);
        reconnectMQTTClient();
    }
    ```

    This code sets the MQTT broker for the client, configures the callback for incoming messages, and attempts to connect to the broker.

1. Call the `createMQTTClient` function in the `setup` function after the WiFi connection is established.

1. Replace the entire `loop` function with the following:

    ```cpp
    void loop()
    {
        reconnectMQTTClient();
        client.loop();
    
        delay(2000);
    }
    ```

    This code starts by reconnecting to the MQTT broker. MQTT connections can be easily disrupted, so it‚Äôs important to regularly check and reconnect if necessary. It then calls the `loop` method on the MQTT client to process any incoming messages on the subscribed topic. Since this app is single-threaded, messages cannot be received in the background, so time on the main thread must be allocated to handle any waiting messages.

    Finally, a 2-second delay ensures the light levels are not sent too frequently, reducing the device‚Äôs power consumption.

1. Upload the code to your Wio Terminal, and use the Serial Monitor to observe the device connecting to WiFi and MQTT.

    ```output
    > Executing task: platformio device monitor <
    
    source /Users/jimbennett/GitHub/IoT-For-Beginners/1-getting-started/lessons/4-connect-internet/code-mqtt/wio-terminal/nightlight/.venv/bin/activate

> üíÅ You can find this code in the [code-mqtt/wio-terminal](../../../../../1-getting-started/lessons/4-connect-internet/code-mqtt/wio-terminal) folder.

üòÄ You have successfully connected your device to an MQTT broker.
