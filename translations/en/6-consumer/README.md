# Consumer IoT - Build a Smart Voice Assistant

The food has been grown, transported to a processing plant, sorted for quality, sold in the store, and now it's time to cook! One of the essential tools in any kitchen is a timer. Originally, timers were hourglasses‚Äîyour food was ready when all the sand had trickled down to the bottom bulb. Later, they became mechanical, then electric.

The latest versions are now part of our smart devices. In kitchens around the world, you'll hear people calling out, "Hey Siri, set a 10-minute timer," or "Alexa, cancel my bread timer." You no longer need to walk back to the kitchen to check on a timer; you can do it from your phone or simply by calling out across the room.

In these four lessons, you'll learn how to build a smart timer that uses AI to recognize your voice, understand your requests, and respond with information about your timer. You'll also add support for multiple languages.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Working with speech and microphone data requires a lot of memory, which means it's easy to hit the limits of microcontrollers. The project here addresses these challenges, but keep in mind that the Wio Terminal labs are complex and may take more time than other labs in this curriculum.

> üíÅ These lessons will use some cloud resources. If you don't complete all the lessons in this project, make sure you [clean up your project](../clean-up.md).
