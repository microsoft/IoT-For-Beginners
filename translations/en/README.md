# IoT for Beginners - A Curriculum  

Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are excited to present a 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum focused on the basics of IoT. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, step-by-step instructions, solutions, assignments, and more. Our project-based approach ensures you learn by doing, which is a proven way to retain new skills.  

The projects follow the journey of food from farm to table, covering farming, logistics, manufacturing, retail, and consumer use—key industries for IoT applications.  

![A road map for the course showing 24 lessons covering intro, farming, transport, processing, retail and cooking](../../translated_images/Roadmap.bb1dec285dda0eda691788b95ddfc96d31d76bb7649e3f04a135e4ad395f323e.en.jpg)

> **Teachers**, we have [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum. If you want to create your own lessons, we’ve also included a [lesson template](lesson-template/README.md).  

> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**, to use this curriculum independently, fork the entire repository and complete the exercises on your own. Start with a pre-lesson quiz, read the lesson, and complete the activities. Try to build the projects by understanding the lessons rather than copying the solution code, though the code is available in the /solutions folders for each project-based lesson. You can also form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further learning, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/users/jimbobbennett/collections/ke2ehd351jopwr?WT.mc_id=academic-17441-jabenn).

## Pedagogy  

We designed this curriculum with two key principles: it’s project-based and includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have built a plant monitoring and watering system, a vehicle tracker, a smart factory setup to monitor and inspect food, and a voice-controlled cooking timer. They will also learn the fundamentals of IoT, including writing device code, connecting to the cloud, analyzing telemetry, and running AI on the edge.  

By aligning the content with projects, the learning process becomes more engaging, and students are more likely to retain the concepts.  

Additionally, low-stakes quizzes before a lesson help students focus on the topic, while post-lesson quizzes reinforce their understanding. This curriculum is designed to be flexible and enjoyable, and it can be completed in its entirety or in parts. The projects start simple and gradually become more complex over the 12-week program.  

Each project uses real-world hardware that is accessible to students and hobbyists. The projects also provide relevant background knowledge about the specific domain. Understanding the context of the problems they are solving helps students think critically about their IoT solutions and their real-world applications.  

## Hardware  

We offer two options for IoT hardware to use in the projects, depending on your preferences, programming skills, learning goals, and availability. For those who don’t have access to hardware or want to learn more before purchasing, we’ve also included a 'virtual hardware' option. You can find more details and a 'shopping list' on the [hardware page](./hardware.md), including links to purchase complete kits from our partners at Seeed Studio.  

> 💁 Check out our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!  

## Each lesson includes:  

- Sketchnote  
- Optional supplemental video  
- Pre-lesson warmup quiz  
- Written lesson  
- Step-by-step guides for project-based lessons  
- Knowledge checks  
- A challenge  
- Supplemental reading  
- Assignment  
- [Post-lesson quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/)  

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are located in the quiz-app folder, with a total of 48 quizzes, each containing three questions. They are linked within the lessons, but the quiz app can also be run locally or deployed to Azure. Follow the instructions in the `quiz-app` folder. Localization of quizzes is ongoing.
