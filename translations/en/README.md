# IoT for Beginners - A Curriculum  

Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are excited to present a 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum focused on the fundamentals of IoT. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, step-by-step instructions, solutions, assignments, and more. This project-based approach helps you learn by doing, which is a proven method for retaining new skills.  

The projects follow the journey of food from farm to table, covering farming, logistics, manufacturing, retail, and consumer use—key industries for IoT applications.

> **Teachers**, we have [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum. If you would like to create your own lessons, we have also included a [lesson template](lesson-template/README.md).  

> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**, to use this curriculum on your own, fork the entire repo and complete the exercises on your own, starting with a pre-lecture quiz, then reading the lecture and completing the rest of the activities. Try to create the projects by comprehending the lessons rather than copying the solution code; however, that code is available in the /solutions folders in each project-oriented lesson. Another idea would be to form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further study, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/users/jimbobbennett/collections/ke2ehd351jopwr?WT.mc_id=academic-17441-jabenn).

## Pedagogy  

We designed this curriculum with two key principles: it is project-based and includes frequent quizzes. By the end of the series, students will have built a plant monitoring and watering system, a vehicle tracker, a smart factory setup to track and check food, and a voice-controlled cooking timer. Along the way, they will learn IoT fundamentals, including writing device code, connecting to the cloud, analyzing telemetry, and running AI on the edge.  

By aligning the content with projects, the learning process becomes more engaging, and students are more likely to retain the concepts.  

Additionally, low-stakes quizzes before and after lessons help set learning intentions and reinforce knowledge. This curriculum is designed to be flexible and enjoyable, allowing students to take it in full or in part. The projects start simple and grow in complexity over the 12-week cycle.  

Each project uses real-world hardware accessible to students and hobbyists. The lessons also provide relevant background knowledge about the project domain, helping students understand the context of the problems they are solving. This approach ensures students learn not just the 'how' but also the 'why' behind their solutions, fostering a deeper appreciation for the end user.  

## Hardware  

We offer two hardware options for the projects, depending on your preferences, programming knowledge, learning goals, and availability. For those without access to hardware or who want to explore before purchasing, we also provide a 'virtual hardware' option. Check out the [hardware page](./hardware.md) for a shopping list, including links to complete kits from our partners at Seeed Studio.  

> 💁 Find our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!  

## Each lesson includes:  

- Sketchnote  
- Optional supplemental video  
- Pre-lesson warmup quiz  
- Written lesson  
- For project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project  
- Knowledge checks  
- A challenge  
- Supplemental reading  
- Assignment  
- [Post-lesson quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/)  
> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are located in the quiz-app folder, with a total of 48 quizzes, each consisting of three questions. They are linked within the lessons, but the quiz app can be run locally or deployed to Azure; follow the instructions in the `quiz-app` folder. Localization is being done progressively.
