# IoT for Beginners - A Curriculum  

Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are excited to present a 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum focused on the fundamentals of IoT. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, step-by-step instructions, solutions, assignments, and more. This project-based approach ensures that you learn by building, a proven method for retaining new skills.  

The projects follow the journey of food from farm to table, covering farming, logistics, manufacturing, retail, and consumer use—key industries for IoT applications.

> **Teachers**, we have [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum. If you'd like to create your own lessons, we’ve also provided a [lesson template](lesson-template/README.md).  

> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**, to use this curriculum independently, fork the repository and complete the exercises on your own. Start with a pre-lesson quiz, then read the lesson and complete the activities. Try to build the projects by understanding the lessons rather than copying the solution code (though the code is available in the /solutions folders for each project-based lesson). Alternatively, form a study group with friends and work through the content together. For further learning, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/users/jimbobbennett/collections/ke2ehd351jopwr?WT.mc_id=academic-17441-jabenn).

## Pedagogy  

This curriculum is built on two key principles: project-based learning and frequent quizzes. By the end of the series, students will have created a plant monitoring and watering system, a vehicle tracker, a smart factory setup for food tracking, and a voice-controlled cooking timer. Along the way, they’ll learn IoT basics, including writing device code, connecting to the cloud, analyzing telemetry, and running AI on the edge.  

By aligning the content with projects, the learning process becomes more engaging, and students are more likely to retain the concepts.  

Additionally, low-stakes quizzes before each lesson help students focus on the topic, while post-lesson quizzes reinforce their understanding. This curriculum is designed to be flexible and enjoyable, allowing students to complete it in full or in part. The projects start simple and grow in complexity over the 12-week period.  

Each project uses real-world hardware accessible to students and hobbyists. The lessons also provide relevant background knowledge about the project domain, helping students understand the context of the problems they’re solving. This approach ensures students learn not just the 'how' but also the 'why' behind their solutions.  

## Hardware  

We offer two hardware options for the projects, depending on your preferences, programming knowledge, learning goals, and availability. For those without access to hardware or who want to explore before purchasing, we’ve also included a 'virtual hardware' option. You can find more details and a 'shopping list' on the [hardware page](./hardware.md), including links to purchase complete kits from Seeed Studio.  

> 💁 Check out our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!  

## Each lesson includes:  

- A sketchnote  
- Optional supplemental video  
- Pre-lesson warmup quiz  
- Written lesson  
- Step-by-step guides for project-based lessons  
- Knowledge checks  
- A challenge  
- Supplemental reading  
- Assignment  
- Post-lesson quiz  

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are located in the quiz-app folder, with 48 quizzes in total (three questions each). They are linked within the lessons but can also be run locally or deployed to Azure. Follow the instructions in the `quiz-app` folder. Localization is in progress.
