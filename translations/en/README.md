# IoT for Beginners - A Curriculum  

Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are excited to present a 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum focused on IoT fundamentals. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, detailed instructions, solutions, assignments, and more. Our project-based approach ensures you learn by building, a proven method for retaining new skills.  

The projects explore the journey of food from farm to table, covering farming, logistics, manufacturing, retail, and consumer stages—key industries for IoT applications.  

![A road map for the course showing 24 lessons covering intro, farming, transport, processing, retail and cooking](../../translated_images/Roadmap.bb1dec285dda0eda691788b95ddfc96d31d76bb7649e3f04a135e4ad395f323e.en.jpg)

> **Teachers**, we have [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum. If you want to create your own lessons, we’ve also provided a [lesson template](lesson-template/README.md).  

> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**, to use this curriculum independently, fork the repository and complete the exercises starting with the pre-lesson quiz, then read the lecture and complete the activities. Try to build the projects by understanding the lessons rather than copying the solution code, although the code is available in the /solutions folders for each project-based lesson. Another idea is to form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further study, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/users/jimbobbennett/collections/ke2ehd351jopwr?WT.mc_id=academic-17441-jabenn).

## Pedagogy  

We’ve adopted two key teaching principles for this curriculum: making it project-based and including frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have built a plant monitoring and watering system, a vehicle tracker, a smart factory setup to track and check food, and a voice-controlled cooking timer, while learning IoT basics such as device coding, cloud connectivity, telemetry analysis, and edge AI.  

By aligning the content with projects, the learning process becomes more engaging, and concept retention is enhanced.  

Additionally, a low-pressure quiz before class helps students focus on the topic, while a post-class quiz reinforces retention. This curriculum is designed to be flexible and enjoyable, allowing students to take it in full or in part. The projects start simple and grow more complex over the 12-week cycle.  

Each project uses real-world hardware accessible to students and hobbyists. The curriculum also provides relevant background knowledge for each project domain. Understanding the domain helps developers solve problems effectively, and this context allows students to think about IoT solutions in real-world scenarios. Students learn the 'why' behind the solutions they build and gain an appreciation for the end user.  

## Hardware  

We offer two IoT hardware options for the projects, depending on personal preferences, programming language knowledge, learning goals, and availability. A 'virtual hardware' version is also available for those without access to physical hardware or who want to learn more before purchasing. You can find a 'shopping list' and more details on the [hardware page](./hardware.md), including links to buy complete kits from Seeed Studio.  

> 💁 Check out our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!  

## Each lesson includes:  

- sketchnote  
- optional supplemental video  
- pre-lesson warmup quiz  
- written lesson  
- for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project  
- knowledge checks  
- a challenge  
- supplemental reading  
- assignment  
- [post-lesson quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/)  
> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are located in the quiz-app folder, with a total of 48 quizzes, each containing three questions. They are linked within the lessons, but the quiz app can be run locally or deployed to Azure; follow the instructions in the `quiz-app` folder. Localization is being done gradually.
