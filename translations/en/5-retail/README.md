# Retail - using IoT to manage stock levels

The final stage before food reaches consumers is retail‚Äîmarkets, greengrocers, supermarkets, and stores that sell products to customers. These businesses aim to ensure their shelves are stocked with items for customers to see and purchase.

One of the most labor-intensive and time-consuming tasks in food stores, especially large supermarkets, is keeping shelves stocked. Employees often need to manually check shelves and fill any gaps with items from storage rooms.

IoT can simplify this process by using AI models on IoT devices to count stock. These machine learning models go beyond simple image classification‚Äîthey can identify individual items and count them.

In these two lessons, you'll learn how to train AI models based on images to count stock and deploy these models on IoT devices.
