# Compare domains

## Instructions

When you created your object detector, you had the option to choose from several domains. Compare how well they perform for your stock detector and explain which one provides better results.

To switch the domain, click the **Settings** button in the top menu, select a new domain, click the **Save changes** button, and then retrain the model. Ensure you test the model using the new iteration trained with the updated domain.

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Train the model with a different domain | Successfully changed the domain and retrained the model | Successfully changed the domain and retrained the model | Unable to change the domain or retrain the model |
| Test the model and compare the results | Successfully tested the model with different domains, compared results, and explained which one is better | Successfully tested the model with different domains but could not compare results or explain which one is better | Unable to test the model with different domains |
