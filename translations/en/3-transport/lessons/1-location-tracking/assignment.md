# Explore Additional GPS Data

## Instructions

The NMEA sentences from your GPS sensor contain more information beyond just location. Explore this additional data and incorporate it into your IoT device.

For example - can you retrieve the current date and time? If you're using a microcontroller, can you set the clock using GPS data in the same way you used NTP signals in the previous project? Can you determine elevation (your height above sea level) or your current speed?

If you're working with a virtual IoT device, you can obtain some of this data by generating NMEA sentences using tools like [nmeagen.org](https://www.nmeagen.org).

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Retrieve additional GPS data | Successfully retrieves and utilizes additional GPS data, either as telemetry or to configure the IoT device | Successfully retrieves additional GPS data but cannot utilize it | Fails to retrieve additional GPS data |
