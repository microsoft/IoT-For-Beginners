## Introduction

In the last three lessons, you used IoT to track the trucks transporting your farm produce to a processing hub. You collected GPS data, sent it to the cloud for storage, and displayed it on a map. The next step in optimizing your supply chain is to receive an alert when a truck is nearing the processing hub. This allows the unloading crew to be ready with forklifts and other equipment as soon as the truck arrives, minimizing waiting time and costs.

In this lesson, you'll learn about geofences‚Äîdefined geospatial areas, such as a region within a 2km drive of a processing hub‚Äîand how to determine whether GPS coordinates are inside or outside a geofence. This will help you track whether your GPS sensor has entered or exited a specific area.

This lesson will cover:

* [What are geofences](../../../../../3-transport/lessons/4-geofences)
* [Define a geofence](../../../../../3-transport/lessons/4-geofences)
* [Test points against a geofence](../../../../../3-transport/lessons/4-geofences)
* [Use geofences from serverless code](../../../../../3-transport/lessons/4-geofences)

> üóë This is the final lesson in this project. After completing this lesson and the assignment, remember to clean up your cloud services. You'll need these services to finish the assignment, so ensure you complete it first.

> Refer to [the clean up your project guide](../../../clean-up.md) if needed for instructions.

## What are Geofences

A geofence is a virtual boundary for a real-world geographic area. Geofences can be circular, defined by a center point and radius (e.g., a 100m circle around a building), or polygonal, covering areas like school zones, city limits, or university campuses.

![Some geofence examples showing a circular geofence around the Microsoft company store, and a polygon geofence around the Microsoft west campus](../../../../../translated_images/geofence-examples.172fbc534665769f6e1a1ddcf75e3b25183cd10354c80cc603ba44b635390e1a.en.png)

> üíÅ You might have used geofences without realizing it. If you've set a location-based reminder using the iOS Reminders app or Google Keep, you've interacted with geofences. These apps create geofences based on the location you provide and notify you when your phone enters the geofence.

There are many reasons to track whether a vehicle is inside or outside a geofence:

* **Unloading preparation**: Receiving a notification when a vehicle arrives on-site allows the crew to prepare for unloading, reducing waiting time. This enables drivers to complete more deliveries in a day.
* **Tax compliance**: In some countries, like New Zealand, road taxes for diesel vehicles are calculated based on mileage driven on public roads. Geofences can help differentiate between public and private roads, such as those on farms or logging sites.
* **Theft monitoring**: If a vehicle is supposed to stay within a specific area, like a farm, leaving the geofence could indicate theft.
* **Location compliance**: Certain areas of a worksite, farm, or factory may be restricted for specific vehicles. For example, vehicles carrying artificial fertilizers and pesticides might need to avoid fields growing organic produce. Entering a geofence could signal non-compliance, prompting a notification to the driver.

‚úÖ Can you think of other applications for geofences?

Azure Maps, the service used in the previous lesson to visualize GPS data, allows you to define geofences and test whether a point is inside or outside them.

## Define a geofence

Geofences are defined using GeoJSON, similar to the points added to the map in the previous lesson. Instead of a `FeatureCollection` of `Point` values, geofences use a `FeatureCollection` containing a `Polygon`.

```json
{
   "type": "FeatureCollection",
   "features": [
     {
       "type": "Feature",
       "geometry": {
         "type": "Polygon",
         "coordinates": [
           [
             [
               -122.13393688201903,
               47.63829579223815
             ],
             [
               -122.13389128446579,
               47.63782047131512
             ],
             [
               -122.13240802288054,
               47.63783312249837
             ],
             [
               -122.13238388299942,
               47.63829037035086
             ],
             [
               -122.13393688201903,
               47.63829579223815
             ]
           ]
         ]
       },
       "properties": {
         "geometryId": "1"
       }
     }
   ]
}
```

Each point in the polygon is represented as a longitude-latitude pair in an array, and these points are grouped into an array set as the `coordinates`. In the previous lesson, a `Point` had `coordinates` as an array with two values (latitude and longitude). For a `Polygon`, `coordinates` is an array of arrays, each containing two values (longitude and latitude).

> üíÅ Remember, GeoJSON uses `longitude, latitude` for points, not `latitude, longitude`.

The polygon's coordinates array always includes one extra entry to close the shape, with the last point being the same as the first. For example, a rectangle would have five points.

![A rectangle with coordinates](../../../../../translated_images/polygon-points.302193da381cb415f46c2c7a98496ee4be05d6c73d21238a89721ad93e121233.en.png)

In the image above, the rectangle's polygon coordinates start at the top-left corner (47,-122), move to the top-right (47,-121), then to the bottom-right (46,-121), bottom-left (46,-122), and finally back to the top-left (47,-122) to close the shape. This results in five points.

‚úÖ Try creating a GeoJSON polygon around your home or school using a tool like [GeoJSON.io](https://geojson.io/).

### Task - define a geofence

To use a geofence in Azure Maps, you first need to upload it to your Azure Maps account. Once uploaded, you'll receive a unique ID to test points against the geofence. Uploading geofences to Azure Maps requires using the maps web API, which can be accessed with a tool like [curl](https://curl.se).

> üéì Curl is a command-line tool for making requests to web endpoints.

1. If you're using Linux, macOS, or a recent version of Windows 10, curl is likely already installed. Run the following command in your terminal or command line to check:

    ```sh
    curl --version
    ```

    If curl isn't installed, download it from the [curl downloads page](https://curl.se/download.html).

    > üíÅ If you're familiar with Postman, you can use it instead.

1. Create a GeoJSON file containing a polygon around your current location. You can manually edit the GeoJSON example above or use a tool like [GeoJSON.io](https://geojson.io).

    The GeoJSON must include a `FeatureCollection` containing a `Feature` with a `geometry` of type `Polygon`.

    Additionally, you **MUST** add a `properties` element at the same level as the `geometry` element, containing a `geometryId`:

    ```json
    "properties": {
        "geometryId": "1"
    }
    ```

    If you use [GeoJSON.io](https://geojson.io), you'll need to manually add this item to the empty `properties` element, either after downloading the JSON file or in the app's JSON editor.

    The `geometryId` must be unique within the file. You can upload multiple geofences as separate `Features` in the same `FeatureCollection`, as long as each has a distinct `geometryId`. Polygons can share the same `geometryId` if uploaded from different files at different times.

1. Save the file as `geofence.json` and navigate to its location in your terminal or console.

1. Run the following curl command to upload the geofence:

    ```sh
    curl --request POST 'https://atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/upload?api-version=1.0&dataFormat=geojson&subscription-key=<subscription_key>' \
         --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         --include \
         --data @geofence.json
    ```

    Replace `<subscription_key>` in the URL with your Azure Maps account's API key.

    The URL uploads map data via the `https://atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/upload` API. The call includes an `api-version` parameter to specify the Azure Maps API version, ensuring backward compatibility. The uploaded data format is set to `geojson`.

    This POST request returns response headers, including a `location` header:

    ```output
    content-type: application/json
    location: https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/operations/1560ced6-3a80-46f2-84b2-5b1531820eab?api-version=1.0
    x-ms-azuremaps-region: West US 2
    x-content-type-options: nosniff
    strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
    x-cache: CONFIG_NOCACHE
    date: Sat, 22 May 2021 21:34:57 GMT
    content-length: 0
    ```

    > üéì Web endpoint calls can include parameters by appending `?` followed by key-value pairs (`key=value`), separated by `&`.

1. Azure Maps processes the upload asynchronously. Check the upload status using the URL in the `location` header. Add your subscription key to the end of the `location` URL by appending `&subscription-key=<subscription_key>`, replacing `<subscription_key>` with your Azure Maps account's API key. Run the following command:

    ```sh
    curl --request GET '<location>&subscription-key=<subscription_key>'
    ```

    Replace `<location>` with the `location` header value and `<subscription_key>` with your API key.

1. Check the `status` value in the response. If it's not `Succeeded`, wait a minute and try again.

1. Once the status is `Succeeded`, check the `resourceLocation` in the response. This contains the unique ID (UDID) for the GeoJSON object. The UDID is the value after `metadata/`, excluding the `api-version`. For example, if the `resourceLocation` is:

    ```json
    {
      "resourceLocation": "https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/metadata/7c3776eb-da87-4c52-ae83-caadf980323a?api-version=1.0"
    }
    ```

    The UDID would be `7c3776eb-da87-4c52-ae83-caadf980323a`.

    Save this UDID for testing the geofence.

## Test points against a geofence

After uploading the polygon to Azure Maps, you can test whether a point is inside or outside the geofence. This requires making a web API request with the geofence's UDID and the point's latitude and longitude.

You can also specify a `searchBuffer` value, which determines the accuracy of the results. GPS isn't perfectly precise, and locations can be off by several meters. The default search buffer is 50m, but you can set it between 0m and 500m.

The API response includes a `distance` value indicating the proximity to the geofence's edge. Positive values mean the point is outside the geofence, while negative values mean it's inside. If the distance is less than the search buffer, the actual distance (in meters) is returned. Otherwise, the value is 999 (outside) or -999 (inside).

![A geofence with a 50m search buffer around it](../../../../../translated_images/search-buffer-and-distance.e6a79af3898183c7b2ef6fbf12271b8b34afd23969bb946962b1b18d3d2635e8.en.png)

In the image above, the geofence has a 50m search buffer:

* A point well inside the geofence and buffer has a distance of **-999**.
* A point far outside the buffer has a distance of **999**.
* A point inside the geofence but near the edge has a distance of **6m**.
* A point outside the geofence but within the buffer has a distance of **39m**.

Knowing the distance to the geofence's edge, combined with other data like GPS readings, speed, and road information, helps make informed decisions about a vehicle's location.

For example, imagine GPS readings showing a vehicle driving along a road near a geofence. If one GPS reading inaccurately places the vehicle inside the geofence, despite no access, it can be disregarded.

![A GPS trail showing a vehicle passing the Microsoft campus on the 520, with GPS readings along the road except for one on the campus, inside a geofence](../../../../../translated_images/geofence-crossing-inaccurate-gps.6a3ed911202ad9cabb66d3964888cec03a42c61d5b8f536ad5bdc99716b370f5.en.png)
In the above image, there is a geofence covering part of the Microsoft campus. The red line represents a truck driving along Highway 520, with circles indicating the GPS readings. Most of these readings are accurate and align with the highway, but one inaccurate reading appears inside the geofence. This reading cannot be correct‚Äîthere are no roads that would allow the truck to suddenly divert from the highway onto the campus and then back onto the highway. The code that evaluates this geofence will need to consider previous readings before acting on the results of the geofence test.

‚úÖ What additional data would you need to verify whether a GPS reading is accurate?

### Task - Test points against a geofence

1. Start by constructing the URL for the web API query. The format is:

    ```output
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/spatial/geofence/json?api-version=1.0&deviceId=gps-sensor&subscription-key=<subscription-key>&udid=<UDID>&lat=<lat>&lon=<lon>
    ```

    Replace `<subscription_key>` with the API key for your Azure Maps account.

    Replace `<UDID>` with the UDID of the geofence from the previous task.

    Replace `<lat>` and `<lon>` with the latitude and longitude you want to test.

    This URL uses the `https://atlas.microsoft.com/spatial/geofence/json` API to query a geofence defined using GeoJSON. It targets the `1.0` API version. The `deviceId` parameter is required and should be the name of the device from which the latitude and longitude are derived.

    The default search buffer is 50 meters, but you can modify this by adding the parameter `searchBuffer=<distance>`, where `<distance>` is the search buffer distance in meters, ranging from 0 to 500.

1. Use curl to make a GET request to this URL:

    ```sh
    curl --request GET '<URL>'
    ```

    > üíÅ If you receive a `BadRequest` response code with the following error:
    >
    > ```output
    > Invalid GeoJSON: All feature properties should contain a geometryId, which is used for identifying the geofence.
    > ```
    >
    > it means your GeoJSON is missing the `properties` section with the `geometryId`. You will need to fix your GeoJSON, then repeat the steps above to re-upload it and obtain a new UDID.

1. The response will include a list of `geometries`, one for each polygon defined in the GeoJSON used to create the geofence. Each geometry contains three fields of interest: `distance`, `nearestLat`, and `nearestLon`.

    ```output
    {
        "geometries": [
            {
                "deviceId": "gps-sensor",
                "udId": "7c3776eb-da87-4c52-ae83-caadf980323a",
                "geometryId": "1",
                "distance": 999.0,
                "nearestLat": 47.645875,
                "nearestLon": -122.142713
            }
        ],
        "expiredGeofenceGeometryId": [],
        "invalidPeriodGeofenceGeometryId": []
    }
    ```

    * `nearestLat` and `nearestLon` represent the latitude and longitude of the point on the edge of the geofence that is closest to the location being tested.

    * `distance` indicates the distance from the tested location to the nearest point on the edge of the geofence. Negative values mean the location is inside the geofence, while positive values mean it is outside. This value will be less than 50 (the default search buffer) or 999.

1. Repeat this process multiple times with locations both inside and outside the geofence.

## Use geofences from serverless code

You can now add a new trigger to your Functions app to test IoT Hub GPS event data against the geofence.

### Consumer groups

As you may recall from earlier lessons, IoT Hub allows you to replay events that have been received but not yet processed. But what happens if multiple triggers are connected? How does it know which trigger has processed which events?

The answer is that it doesn‚Äôt! Instead, you can define multiple separate connections to read events, with each connection managing the replay of unread messages. These are called *consumer groups*. When connecting to the endpoint, you specify which consumer group to use. Each component of your application connects to a different consumer group.

![One IoT Hub with 3 consumer groups distributing the same messages to 3 different functions apps](../../../../../translated_images/consumer-groups.a3262e26fc27ba2092863678ad57af15c7223416e388a23f330c058cf4358630.en.png)

In theory, up to five applications can connect to each consumer group, and all will receive messages as they arrive. However, it‚Äôs best practice to have only one application access each consumer group to avoid duplicate message processing and ensure that all queued messages are processed correctly when restarting. For example, if you run your Functions app locally while it‚Äôs also running in the cloud, both instances would process messages, leading to duplicate blobs in the storage account.

If you review the `function.json` file for the IoT Hub trigger you created earlier, you‚Äôll see the consumer group in the event hub trigger binding section:

```json
"consumerGroup": "$Default"
```

When you create an IoT Hub, the `$Default` consumer group is created by default. If you want to add another trigger, you can do so using a new consumer group.

> üíÅ In this lesson, you‚Äôll use a different function to test the geofence than the one used to store GPS data. This demonstrates how to use consumer groups and separate code for better readability and understanding. In a production application, there are many ways to architect this‚Äîcombining both in one function, using a trigger on the storage account to run a function to check the geofence, or using multiple functions. There‚Äôs no single "right way"; it depends on your application and its requirements.

### Task - Create a new consumer group

1. Run the following command to create a new consumer group called `geofence` for your IoT Hub:

    ```sh
    az iot hub consumer-group create --name geofence \
                                     --hub-name <hub_name>
    ```

    Replace `<hub_name>` with the name of your IoT Hub.

1. To view all consumer groups for an IoT Hub, run the following command:

    ```sh
    az iot hub consumer-group list --output table \
                                   --hub-name <hub_name>
    ```

    Replace `<hub_name>` with the name of your IoT Hub. This will list all consumer groups.

    ```output
    Name      ResourceGroup
    --------  ---------------
    $Default  gps-sensor
    geofence  gps-sensor
    ```

> üíÅ In an earlier lesson, the IoT Hub event monitor connected to the `$Default` consumer group. This is why you couldn‚Äôt run the event monitor and an event trigger simultaneously. To run both, use other consumer groups for all your function apps and reserve `$Default` for the event monitor.

### Task - Create a new IoT Hub trigger

1. Add a new IoT Hub event trigger to your `gps-trigger` function app from an earlier lesson. Name this function `geofence-trigger`.

    > ‚ö†Ô∏è Refer to [the instructions for creating an IoT Hub event trigger from project 2, lesson 5 if needed](../../../2-farm/lessons/5-migrate-application-to-the-cloud/README.md#create-an-iot-hub-event-trigger).

1. Configure the IoT Hub connection string in the `function.json` file. The `local.settings.json` file is shared among all triggers in the Function App.

1. Update the `consumerGroup` value in the `function.json` file to reference the new `geofence` consumer group:

    ```json
    "consumerGroup": "geofence"
    ```

1. Add the subscription key for your Azure Maps account to the `local.settings.json` file as a new entry called `MAPS_KEY`.

1. Run the Functions App to ensure it connects and processes messages. The `iot-hub-trigger` from the earlier lesson will also run and upload blobs to storage.

    > To avoid duplicate GPS readings in blob storage, stop the Functions App running in the cloud. Use the following command:
    >
    > ```sh
    > az functionapp stop --resource-group gps-sensor \
    >                     --name <functions_app_name>
    > ```
    >
    > Replace `<functions_app_name>` with the name of your Functions App.
    >
    > Restart it later with the following command:
    >
    > ```sh
    > az functionapp start --resource-group gps-sensor \
    >                     --name <functions_app_name>
    > ```
    >
    > Replace `<functions_app_name>` with the name of your Functions App.

### Task - Test the geofence from the trigger

Earlier, you used curl to query a geofence to determine if a point was inside or outside. You can make a similar web request from within your trigger.

1. To query the geofence, you need its UDID. Add a new entry to the `local.settings.json` file called `GEOFENCE_UDID` with this value.

1. Open the `__init__.py` file from the new `geofence-trigger` trigger.

1. Add the following import at the top of the file:

    ```python
    import json
    import os
    import requests
    ```

    The `requests` package allows you to make web API calls. Since Azure Maps doesn‚Äôt have a Python SDK, you‚Äôll need to use web API calls in your Python code.

1. Add the following two lines at the start of the `main` method to retrieve the Maps subscription key:

    ```python
    maps_key = os.environ['MAPS_KEY']
    geofence_udid = os.environ['GEOFENCE_UDID']    
    ```

1. Inside the `for event in events` loop, add the following code to extract the latitude and longitude from each event:

    ```python
    event_body = json.loads(event.get_body().decode('utf-8'))
    lat = event_body['gps']['lat']
    lon = event_body['gps']['lon']
    ```

    This code converts the JSON from the event body into a dictionary and extracts the `lat` and `lon` from the `gps` field.

1. Instead of building a long URL as you did with curl, use the URL and pass the parameters as a dictionary. Add the following code to define the URL and configure the parameters:

    ```python
    url = 'https://atlas.microsoft.com/spatial/geofence/json'

    params = {
        'api-version': 1.0,
        'deviceId': 'gps-sensor',
        'subscription-key': maps_key,
        'udid' : geofence_udid,
        'lat' : lat,
        'lon' : lon
    }
    ```

    The items in the `params` dictionary correspond to the key-value pairs used when calling the web API via curl.

1. Add the following lines of code to call the web API:

    ```python
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    response_body = json.loads(response.text)
    ```

    This calls the URL with the parameters and retrieves a response object.

1. Add the following code below this:

    ```python
    distance = response_body['geometries'][0]['distance']

    if distance == 999:
        logging.info('Point is outside geofence')
    elif distance > 0:
        logging.info(f'Point is just outside geofence by a distance of {distance}m')
    elif distance == -999:
        logging.info(f'Point is inside geofence')
    else:
        logging.info(f'Point is just inside geofence by a distance of {distance}m')
    ```

    This code assumes there is one geometry and extracts the distance from it. It logs different messages based on the distance.

1. Run this code. The logging output will indicate whether the GPS coordinates are inside or outside the geofence, along with the distance if the point is within 50 meters. Test this code with different geofences based on your GPS sensor‚Äôs location. Try moving the sensor (e.g., tethered to WiFi from a mobile phone or with different coordinates on the virtual IoT device) to observe changes.

1. When ready, deploy this code to your Functions app in the cloud. Don‚Äôt forget to deploy the new Application Settings.

## üöÄ Challenge

In this lesson, you added one geofence using a GeoJSON file with a single polygon. You can upload multiple polygons simultaneously, as long as they have different `geometryId` values in the `properties` section.

Try uploading a GeoJSON file with multiple polygons and modify your code to determine which polygon the GPS coordinates are closest to or inside.
