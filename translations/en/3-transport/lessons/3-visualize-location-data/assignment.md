# Deploy your app

## Instructions

There are several ways to deploy your app and share it with the world, such as using GitHub Pages or one of many service providers. A great option is to use Azure Static Web Apps. In this assignment, build your web app and deploy it to the cloud by following [these instructions](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli) or watching [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADVGIXciYn8&list=PLlrxD0HtieHgMPeBaDQFx9yNuFxx6S1VG&index=3).  
One advantage of using Azure Static Web Apps is that you can securely store API keys in the portal. Take this opportunity to refactor your subscriptionKey as a variable and store it in the cloud.
