# Recommended learning model

For the best learning outcomes, **we recommend a “Flipped Model" approach** similar to science labs: students work on projects during class time, with opportunities for discussion, Q&A, and project assistance, while completing the lecture components as pre-reads on their own time.

## Why Flipped Learning?

1. This teaching method engages various learning styles – visual, auditory, hands-on, problem-solving, etc.[[1]](../..)
2. Flipped classrooms have been shown to improve focus, engagement, motivation, self-reliance, knowledge retention, and communication (both between teachers and students, and among students themselves).[[2,3]](../..)
3. As instructors, you can dedicate more time to students who are struggling while allowing advanced learners the freedom to move ahead.[[4]](../..)

We also encourage instructors to take on the role of **“Co-Facilitator"**, learning alongside students and supporting them as they explore questions and ideas driven by their own interests and insights.

There’s no single “right way" to approach this. Sometimes, you won’t have all the answers. Some students may not complete all the projects. Your goal is to help students naturally develop problem-solving skills that may be more playful, collaborative, or self-directed than they initially expected.

## Helpful Facilitation Tips:

* Reflect on what you observe, ask questions, and make comments.
* Use phrases like “I notice…" and “I wonder…"
* Connect students who are struggling with those who have already found solutions.
* Point out components or suggest different approaches if a student is stuck. Encourage them to change one thing at a time and observe the results.
* Acknowledge frustration and recognize effort.
* Avoid building or coding for the students, except when they need physical assistance.

## Sample Facilitation Language:

* “Ask two others before you ask me."
* “Spend another two minutes trying…"
* “Let’s take a break from this. Maybe you could help other students with their electrical connections since you’ve already figured that out?"
* “I wonder if another student has had the same problem. Let’s check!"
* "You really committed to this and figured it out! Could I send others to you for help with this?"
* “That’s odd, it doesn’t make sense to me, either. Maybe we could ask another student, or if you figure it out, could you share with the class?"
