# Learn about cloud services

## Instructions

Cloud platforms, like Microsoft's Azure, provide more than just virtual machines for rent. The main categories of cloud services include:

* Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
* Platform as a service (PaaS)
* Serverless
* Software as a service (SaaS)

Understand these different types of services, and explain what they are and how they differ. Discuss which services are most relevant for IoT developers.
