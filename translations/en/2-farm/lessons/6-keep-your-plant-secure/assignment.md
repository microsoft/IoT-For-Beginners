# Build a new IoT device

## Instructions

Over the past six lessons, you have explored digital agriculture and learned how to use IoT devices to collect data for predicting plant growth and automating irrigation based on soil moisture readings.

Apply what youâ€™ve learned to create a new IoT device using a sensor and actuator of your choice. Send telemetry data to an IoT Hub and use it to control an actuator through serverless code. You can use a sensor and actuator from this or a previous project, or experiment with new hardware if available.

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Code an IoT device to use a sensor and actuator | Successfully coded an IoT device that integrates both a sensor and an actuator | Coded an IoT device that integrates either a sensor or an actuator | Unable to code an IoT device that integrates a sensor or an actuator |
| Connect the IoT device to IoT Hub | Successfully deployed an IoT Hub, sent telemetry data to it, and received commands from it | Successfully deployed an IoT Hub and either sent telemetry data or received commands | Unable to deploy an IoT Hub or establish communication with it from an IoT device |
| Control the actuator using serverless code | Successfully deployed an Azure Function to control the device, triggered by telemetry events | Successfully deployed an Azure Function triggered by telemetry events but unable to control the actuator | Unable to deploy an Azure Function |
