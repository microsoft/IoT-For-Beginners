# Images

The images in the [icons](../../../images/icons) folder are sourced from the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com) and require attribution. Each image specifies the necessary attribution. These images should be used in any diagram that requires them to maintain visual consistency.

The [Diagrams.sketch](../../../images/Diagrams.sketch) file is a [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) document that contains all the diagrams used in the lessons and projects. If you are working on a translation, please translate these as well, either by copying and updating the document or by providing a list of the words that need translation as a GitHub issue.

The remaining images are used throughout the lessons and projects.
