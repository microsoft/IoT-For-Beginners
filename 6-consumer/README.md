# Consumer IoT - build a smart voice assistant

The fod has been grown, driven to a processing plant, sorted for quality, sold in the store and now it's time to cook! One of the core pieces of any kitchen is a timer. Initially these started as simple hour glasses - your food was cooked when all the sand trickled down into the bottom bulb. They then went clockwork, then electric.

The latest iterations are now part of our smart devices. In kitchens all throughout the world you'll head chefs shouting "Hey Siri - set a 10 minute timer", or "Alexa - cancel my bread timer". No longer do you have to walk back to the kitchen to check on a timer, you can do it from your phone, or a call out across the room.

In these 4 lessons you'll learn how to build a smart timer, using AI to recognize your voice, understand what you are asking for, and reply with information about your timer. You'll also add support for multiple languages.
